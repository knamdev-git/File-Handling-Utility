TASK-DESCRIPTION :

The File Handling Utility project is a Java-based program designed to perform fundamental file operations such as creating, writing, reading, and updating text files. This project was developed as part of an internship task to gain hands-on experience in Java programming, particularly in working with file handling and user interaction through the command-line interface. The utility enables users to manage text files efficiently and interactively, making it a practical tool for handling various data storage requirements.

The development environment for this project was Visual Studio Code (VS Code), a widely used code editor that offers powerful extensions and debugging tools. VS Code was chosen for its user-friendly interface, lightweight nature, and seamless integration with Java development kits. The program was written and tested using the Java Development Kit (JDK), ensuring compatibility with different systems. The Java Scanner class was utilized to handle user input, allowing dynamic interaction with the program.

Tasks Performed :

File Creation – The program allows users to create a new text file dynamically.

Data Insertion – Users can input text data into the file.

File Reading – The utility reads and displays file contents.

File Updating – Users can overwrite existing data with new input.

This project has practical applications in various domains, including data logging, configuration management, and simple database management. Many software applications require logging user activities, and this utility can be adapted to store such logs in a structured manner. Additionally, configuration settings for software programs are often stored in text files, and this tool provides a basic framework for managing such settings. For small-scale applications that do not require a full-fledged database, this utility serves as an efficient way to store textual data in files.

Working on this project as an internship task has provided valuable experience in Java programming, particularly in file handling techniques. It has strengthened the understanding of working with external resources such as files, handling user input efficiently, and implementing structured programming practices.
